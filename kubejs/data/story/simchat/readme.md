ideas
- entity which buys things from you for very little return but on milestones gives you information on other companies and seeds for more quests and information
- small government on a planet that died due to extreme capitalism seeking help rebuilding, help is not very profitable but you feel good helping them. Later you when they discover a valuable resource you can encourage them to exploit it and bring them down again but profit or tell them not to exploit it. In either choice you get they circle back again so you get a chance to "change your mind" 
- quests that involve presence in the system
    - a mercenary company that you can hire to do work for you, fight other entities, steal 
    - a way for you to "recruit" 
- offers that have deadlines
- betrayal options 
- entities interact with eachother
    - competing companies can undercut eachother, sabotage eachother
    - companies can merge or be acquired
    - companies can go bankrupt or thrive based on your actions or independent events

- Temporary or permanent price-fixing alliances. Joining stabilizes demand but caps margins. Breaking them triggers retaliation.
- Fund regulators to skew safety, emissions, or labor rules in your favor. Long-term risk of public backlash or reform waves.
- You can work with a company to manufacture a product and chose costcutting or quality and it effects reputation and future offers.
- Commodity hype cycles driven by rumors and data leaks. Ride, short, or puncture bubbles.
- Media Arms Own or influence outlets to shape demand, suppress scandals, or inflate rivals’ costs.
- Early contracts that give you better terms if you garentee something later on which may haunt you in the late game.
- loans
- develop a new processing line and with the help of an enthusiastic partner you can patent it or, once his rival contacts you, open source it and give it away (giving up potential future profits but gaining reputation and allies)
- Ability to request advanced payment, getting less reputation but more immediate cashflow
- Loans from shady companies
- Artificial scarcity plays - A company asks you to stop producing a product temporarily so they can drain market stockpiles and spike prices. You get a cut, but smaller producers get squeezed out and may remember.
- Dumping contracts - Sell at a loss to bankrupt a competitor. The company funding this pays you the difference plus a bonus, but you've now made an enemy and established yourself as "for hire."
- Vertical integration pressure - A company you supply starts acquiring your other buyers. Eventually they offer to acquire you (game over? prestige ending?) or you can fight back by diversifying.
- The whistleblower - An employee from Company X contacts you with evidence of their unsafe practices. Expose them (tanks their reputation, they become hostile, regulators thank you), sell the info back to X (they owe you a favor), or sell it to their competitor.
- Reputation laundering - A despised company offers premium rates if you'll act as a middleman, selling their products under your name. Easy money until someone finds out.
- The face-saving contract - A company publicly announced a product they can't actually produce. They'll pay you handsomely to secretly supply it. If you ever reveal this, they're ruined but you become known as untrustworthy.
- The inspection - Regulators are coming. You can pause shady operations (lost productivity), bribe them (risk of exposure), or just take the fine (public record).
- The disaster - A company's facility explodes. They desperately need product to cover obligations. You can gouge them, help at fair rates (they'll remember), or help a different company capitalize on the gap.
- The cooperative - A workers' co-op offers worse rates but gives you a "fair trade" reputation modifier that unlocks certain clients and closes off others.
- The bailout - A struggling company begs for a loan. You can give fair terms (risky, low return), predatory terms (you might end up owning them), or refuse (they go under, market consolidates).
- The investigation — If you've been too shady, an investigative entity starts building a case. You can lie low, destroy evidence (risk), bribe witnesses (risk), or get ahead of it by self-reporting (controlled damage).
